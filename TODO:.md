# Next:

- Check how the multiple constrained zonotopes that create the hybrid zonotope are defined, cause there seems to be some peculiar behavior
  with the offset of the center of the different constrained zonotopes. 



- Pay rent

- Redesign the environment:
    - Make it square
        - This is so that we can perhaps simplify the representation of the Hybrid zonotopes for the inner and outer lanes.


- Call bank for the 18-25 card (check what time the bank opens)

- Ask Miguel about his Thesis defense
- Read papers for Kyriako's idea

Dear Jana

My name is Loizos Hadjiloizou and I am a second year master student in Systems, Control and Robotics at KTH. I am reaching out to you to express my interest
in pursuing a PhD at KTH and I was wondering if you have any available opportunities.

A couple of months ago I came across your work and your lecture in UofT on formal methods for planning AND CONTROL in robotics, which I find to be of great interest to me. Therefore, I am reaching out to you specifically as I would like to discuss with you and further explore the possibility of doing a PhD under your supervision.

During the past years I had the opportunity to gain some experience within the domain of academic research through my collaboration with Professor Themistoklis Charalambous (https://themistoklis.org/), with whom I have written two papers that have been accepted to peer-reviewed conferences. Both papers deal with linear optimal control and navigation of quadrotors under intermittent sensor measurements.

Currently, I am working on my MSc thesis under the supervision of the doctoral student Frank Jiang. In the thesis we use formal methods to provide guarantees regarding the behavior of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. We achieve this with a combination of Hybrid Zonotopes and temporal logic specifications and the construction of temporal logic trees. This approach has the potential to provide real-time guarantees for rich and rigorous task descriptions. Following this work, we aim to form a publishable paper in a peer-reviewed conference.

These collaborations, my interraction with multiple professors and doctoral students in Stockholm have reinforced my conviction of doing a PhD here at KTH.

I am attaching my CV below to better depict my experience level and skills within the field.

Thank you for your time. I appreciate your consideration and I look forward further discussing on the matter if you find that our goals are aligned.

Best regards,
Loizos





Dear Mikael

My name is Loizos Hadjiloizou and I am a second year master student in Systems, Control and Robotics. I am reaching out to you to express my interest in pursuing a PhD at KTH and I was wondering if you have any available opportunities.

I had the opportunity to meet you last year when I enrolled to your course on Model Predictive Control. During that time I've expressed my interest in
doing my MSc thesis under your supervision. Although I did not have the opportunity to work under your supervision, I would love to explore the possibility
of doing a PhD under your supervision.

During the past years I had the opportunity to gain some experience within the domain of academic research through my collaboration with Themis, with whom I have written two papers that have been accepted to peer-reviewed conferences. Both papers deal with linear optimal control and navigation of quadrotors under intermittent sensor measurements.

I am attaching my CV and my transcripts. Thank you for your time. I appreciate your consideration and I look forward discussing with you if you find that my
background is a good fit for any opportunities you might have.

Hello Jonas

My name is Loizos Hadjiloizou, I am an MSc student currently doing my thesis under the supervision of Frank. I am reaching out to you as I want to pursue a PhD here at KTH in control-related topics. I've expressed this interest to Frank and he suggested I get in touch with you to discuss about the possibility of doing a PhD under your supervision. Therefore, I was wondering if you would be interested in meeting to explore this possibility.

A few things about my background. I had the opportunity to gain some experiene within the domain of academic research through my collaboration with Themistoklis Charalambous (https://themistoklis.org/), with whom we have published two papers to peer-reviewed conferences. Both papers deal with linear optimal control and navigation of quadrotors under intermittent sensor measurements. In addition, as we've already discussed during past ITRL meetings, my thesis is concrened with the use of formal methods to provide guarantees for the behaviour of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. More precisely, we achieve with the combination of hybrid zonotopes and temporal logic specifications. This approach has the potential to provide real-time guarantees for rich and rigorous task descriptions.

I am also attaching my CV below to better depict my background.

Thank you for your time. I appreciate your consideration and I am looking forward hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Loizos
