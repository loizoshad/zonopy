# Questions

- Q1: Judging from your work there are no evidence suggesting that UAMs are nearly as efficient as ground equipment. During your work and through the insights you've gained during your research, what do you think are some promising avenues for UAMs to become more efficient?

- Q2: If it is about entirely removing trees, why not use small ground vehicles that can navigate through the forest? It seems like it would be much more efficient and stable than using UAMs (That is also because the access to the foresst from above is limited by the trees themselves). However if you are mainly interested in thining out the branches of the trees, then UAMs sound like a viable option.

- Q3: Could you please tell me a few other alternative UAMs and how your approach compares to them?



# Notes

- I suggest you rewrite your abstract to be more focused on what you did and what you found, you also need to mention some of the results you found.

- Your motivation/contributions is heavily focused on the general benefits of advancing UAV and UAM technology, should it perhaps be more focused on the problem you are trying to solve (forests)?
