With the theory established, we can now move on to our approach for generating TLTs from abstract tasks, all while dealing with online changes in the environment. Our work will be motivated through a simple scenario where a car needs to navigate its way towards the exit of a parking lot, and eventually augment the scenario to include moving obstacles. Thus, the original goal can be described by the LTL formula \ref{} for the environment in Figure~\ref{}
