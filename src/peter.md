- I feel like my recent experience with reachability analysis... will allow me to bring a fresh persepctive on the (pursuit evasion) problems...




1 Describe in maximum 500 characters why you are interested in this particular Doctoral student-position and project?

Throughout my BSc and MSc studies, I delved into localization, control theory, and reachability analysis, developing a major interest for these areas. This project's Pursuit-Evasion nature offers a great blend of these subjects and it would allow me to deepen my understanding of them. Moreover, the potential to address real-world issues through this project greatly excites me.




2 Describe in maximum 500 characters what you think you can contribute with to the project and the research group.
My research background in reachability for autonomous systems alongside previous academic experience on drone localization equips me to provide valuable insights into the project. I plan to leverage my experience from the KTH FoilCart project to bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementation. With a blend of robotics expertise and hands-on problem-solving, I'm prepared to contribute to innovative solutions that integrate theory and real-world application.
