# For these results we used:

## Dynamic model:
    - We assume that the car can move with a maximum velocity of 0.5m/s
    - In addition we assume a discretization time step of 0.1s
    - Therefore the velocity of the maximum car is 0.05m / step

## Environment settings:
    - The step size in x should be
