# Preliminaries

## Notation
## Plant Model

## Reachability Analysis
    - Forward Reachability (FRS)
    - Backward Reachability (BRS)
    - Invariant Sets

## Temporal Logic
- Linear Temporal Logic
- Temporal Logic Trees

    - Section Description:
        - By the end of this section you need to provide an overview of what are the necessary and/or important characteristics of a set representation that is needed to construct the temporal logic trees. This is can be used as a pass for the next section to mootivate the use of hybrid zonotopes
            - If you wanna have the ability to deal with any meaningful temporal logic specifications, you will generally need to deal with:
                - Non-convex sets
                - Disjoint sets
            - Since TLTs have the potential for real-time construction, model checking and formal control synthesis, it would be ideal to deal 
            - Of Fast computations with 

## Set Representation
    - Level Sets
    - Polytopes
    - Zonotopes
    - Constrained Zonotopes
    - Hybrid Zonotopes

    - Section Description:
        - Provide an overview of the general idea behind different type of set representations, and how they can handle convexity, non-convexity, disjoint sets, closed under different operations.

# Our Approach

## Show an example of the computation of the entire 

## RCI for Hybrid zonotopes
    - Provide an algorithm for it
    - Show examples:
        - First start with a static object
        - Then move to a moving object
            - Ask Frank if you can term it as "moving RCI" or something like that in case this idea does not already formally exist
        - 2D or 3D?
